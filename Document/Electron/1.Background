# Electron Framework 

1. Structure:
- Main process: Manages application lifecycle, windows, and can acccess OS features
- Renderer process: Run the UI (HTML, CSS, JS), similiar to a browser tab.
Can use framework like ReactJS, Vue, etc...

2. How Electron works
When you start an Electron app
1. The main process launches first 
2. It create browser windows (renderer processes) to display the UI 
3. Main and renderer processes can communicate via IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
